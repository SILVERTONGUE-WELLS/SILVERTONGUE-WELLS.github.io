    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="article-columns">
      <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s a computer science student with a passion for design, I find myself at the intersection of technology and aesthetics. My academic journey in computer science has equipped me with the technical skills to build robust systems, while my love for design—particularly the classic layouts of newspapers and magazines—has given me a unique perspective on how information should be presented.</p>
      <p>The elegant typography of The New York Times, the bold visuals of Rolling Stone, and the clean layouts of The Guardian have all influenced my approach to design. I believe that code should not only function well but also create experiences that resonate visually and emotionally with users.</p>
