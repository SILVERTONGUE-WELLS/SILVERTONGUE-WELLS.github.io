      <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>'m a Computer Science student passionate about exploring the intersection of distributed systems, machine learning, and systems programming. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTECH) with an exchange semester at The University of Sydney.</p>
      
      <p>My research focuses on developing efficient algorithms and frameworks for complex computational problems. I'm particularly interested in federated learning and multimodal alignment in large models, and currently serve as a research assistant in two labs at SUSTECH.</p>
      
      <p>Beyond academics, I've taken on leadership roles, including serving as the head of Student Rights department at SUSTECH Student Union, where I implemented digital solutions to improve campus life. I'm dedicated to creating innovative systems that solve real-world problems.</p>
